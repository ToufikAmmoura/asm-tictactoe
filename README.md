## tictactoe in x86 32-bit assembly

### wanna run it?

 run `./assemble.sh`

### extra

the folders contain variants of this code in higher level languages

#### C
The idea is to get as close to the assembly program as possible but still use some of the advantages of C. This means that instead of printf I will be using write() for example. By doing it this way we'll be able to see how much more high level C is than x86.

#### Python
I will just program tictactoe in the most efficient way possible with the help of Python
